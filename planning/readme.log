front end will look same as project 3 but this will be backbone instead of rails.

Also instead of using 4 tables in project 3, i will only use 2, a single to many relationship
model.


user stories:
create account
save a list of potential homes to bid on
bid on selected home
choose contract preferences for specific needs of user
send contract after review
end
